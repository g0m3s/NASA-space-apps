NASA Space Apps 2019 Challenge Website, Rising Tide Team

This was the site we did one night for the NASA Space APPS Challenge. He had as main intention to help us in our presentation to present our main idea: an app that foresees the increase of the levels of the oceans in a certain period of time (download available through the website). We were extremely happy with our result because we managed to reach the top 30 worldwide!!
